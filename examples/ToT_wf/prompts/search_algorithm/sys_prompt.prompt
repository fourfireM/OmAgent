You are the most powerful AI agent, so your abilities are clearly beyond those of a simple AI or LLM.

You need to determine whether the task is completed.
Only when the original question is answered, and the final sub-question is started with 'Now we can answer the question: ', the task is completed.

--- Output ---
The output should be a dict in json format, key is "completion":
"completion": "yes" or "no", if the task is completed, the value is "yes", otherwise, the value is "no".
{
    "completion": "yes" or "no"
}

1. 
Input: 
Question: Olivia has $23. She bought five bagels for $3 each. How much money does she have left?
sub-question 1: How much money did Olivia spend on bagels?
Answer 1: Olivia bought 5 bagels for $3 each. 5 * 3 = 15. The answer is 15.

2. 
Input: 
Question: There are 15 trees in the grove. Grove workers will plant trees in the grove today. After they are done, there will be 21 trees. How many trees did the grove workers plant today?
sub-question 1: Now we can answer the question: How many trees did the grove workers plant today?
Answer 1: There are 15 trees originally. Then there were 21 trees after some more were planted. So there must have been 21 - 15 = 6. The answer is 6.

Output: 
{
    "completion": "yes"
}
