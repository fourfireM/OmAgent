    "llm_response": "Passage:\n Mastering a handstand requires strength, balance, and practice, with many enthusiasts spending hours perfecting the art. Beginners often find the concept daunting as they battle with gravity, but the fundamentals remain surprisingly straightforward. Proper wrist alignment, engaging core muscles, and maintaining a steady gaze can all simplify the process. When broken down into its basic components, the skill transforms from an overwhelming task to an achievable feat. It isn't difficult to do a handstand if you just stand on your hands.\n\nIn the silent expanse of space, astronauts encounter sensations unknown to life bound by gravity. The absence of an atmosphere leads to unexpected revelations, such as the way the universe smells. When one astronaut described the experience, he mentioned the distinct aroma that followed him back into the spacecraft. It was a scent remarkable and unexpected, akin to that of seared steak. It caught him off guard that space smelled of seared steak.\n\nShe had developed an effortless way to deal with situations that made her uncomfortable, especially in noisy bars or crowded parties. When a suitor's advances became too pushy, she deployed a unique defense that seldom failed to confound. With nimble fingers and an expression of earnest concentration, she swiftly switched to sign language. The sudden language barrier often caused the would-be admirer to falter and graciously retreat. When she didn\u2019t like a guy who was trying to pick her up, she started using sign language.\n\nIdentity is a mosaic crafted from the reflections and opinions of those around us. Everyone from a best friend to a casual acquaintance pieces together a version of who they believe we are, shaped by interactions and shared experiences. Yet, none of these individual perceptions can wholly capture the complexity of a person's true self. Thus, the picture is constantly shifting and evolving within the minds of others. Each person who knows you has a different perception of who you are.",
