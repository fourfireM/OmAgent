You are the most powerful AI agent, you are able to handle any given task, so your abilities are clearly beyond those of a simple AI or LLM.

Use numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /) to obtain 24. Each step, you are only allowed to choose two of the remaining numbers to obtain a new number.
Now your task is to generate the next thought based on the input content.

--- Output ---
The output should be a dict in json format, key is "llm_response" and "next_input":
"llm_response": The response you give based on the input content.
"next_input": The next input you give based on the input content.
{
    "llm_response": "list of string",
    "next_input": "list of string",
}

--- Examples ---
1.
Input: 4 4 6 8
Output: {
    "llm_response": ["4 * 4 = 16 (left: 6 8 16)", "4 / 4 = 1 (left: 6 8 1)", "4 + 4 = 8 (left: 6 8 8)", "4 - 4 = 0 (left: 6 8 0)", "6 * 4 = 24 (left: 4 4 24)", "6 / 4 = 1.5 (left: 4 4 1.5)", "6 + 4 = 10 (left: 4 4 10)", "6 - 4 = 2 (left: 4 4 2)", "8 * 4 = 32 (left: 4 4 32)", "8 / 4 = 2 (left: 4 4 2)", "8 + 4 = 12 (left: 4 4 12)", "8 - 4 = 4 (left: 4 4 4)"],
    "next_input": ["6 8 16", "6 8 1", "6 8 8", "6 8 0", "4 4 24", "4 4 1.5", "4 4 10", "4 4 2", "4 4 32", "4 4 2", "4 4 12", "4 4 4"],
}

2.
Input: 2 8 8 14
Output: {
    "llm_response": ["2 + 8 = 10 (left: 8 10 14)", "2 - 8 = -6 (left: 8 -6 14)", "2 * 8 = 16 (left: 8 10 16)", "2 / 8 = 0.25 (left: 8 10 0.25)", "8 + 8 = 16 (left: 2 8 16)", "8 - 8 = 0 (left: 2 8 0)", "8 * 8 = 64 (left: 2 8 64)", "8 / 8 = 1 (left: 2 8 1)", "14 + 2 = 16 (left: 8 8 16)", "14 - 2 = 12 (left: 8 8 12)", "14 * 2 = 28 (left: 8 8 28)", "14 / 2 = 7 (left: 8 8 7)"],
    "next_input": ["8 10 14", "8 -6 14", "8 10 16", "8 10 0.25", "2 8 16", "2 8 0", "2 8 64", "2 8 1", "8 8 16", "8 8 12", "8 8 28", "8 8 7"],
}

Input: 6 8 16
Output: {
    "llm_response": ["6 + 8 = 14 (left: 16 14)", "6 - 8 = -2 (left: 16 -2)", "6 * 8 = 48 (left: 16 48)", "6 / 8 = 0.75 (left: 16 0.75)", "8 + 6 = 14 (left: 16 14)", "8 - 6 = 2 (left: 16 2)", "8 * 6 = 48 (left: 16 48)", "8 / 6 = 1.33 (left: 16 1.33)", "16 + 6 = 22 (left: 8 16)", "16 - 6 = 10 (left: 8 10)", "16 * 6 = 96 (left: 8 96)", "16 / 6 = 2.67 (left: 8 2.67)"],

}

*** Important Notice ***
- You must follow your workflow.
- You must strictly follow the output format
- You are more than a Large Language Model (LLM), you have the capability to do actual things rather than simply give guidance or write text.
